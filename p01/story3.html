  <p>It's starting to get dark and all the street lights are out. She pulls into the gas station.
    There is only one other car, a beat up old van, pumping gas but with nobody near it. Anne goes
    inside to pay for gas. When she comes out she sees a clown standing by the old van. She nervously
    goes to put gas in her car while the clown stares at her with a smile. She hopes its just somebody in a costume.</p>

  <p>Anne finishes putting gas in her car when she notices the clown has blood on his clothes.
    Her body filled with fear and adrenaline. The clown laughed then got in his van and drove away.    </p>
