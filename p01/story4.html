  <!--Jack Spencer-->
  <p>Anne drives away in a hurry. She races down the narrow street and all of the sudden
  a car behind her starts honking. She signals the car to go around, but it continues to honk.
   She looks more closely in the mirror and sees a van driven by the clown following closely behind her.</p>
  <p>All of the sudden the van hits Annes car and forces it off the road!</p>
