  <h1>Heading</h1>

  <p>It is October 30th, the day before Halloween.
    Anne's roommates are out buying decorations for their haunted house.
    She is home alone watching the news and a story comes on about a killer clown on the loose. All of the sudden the power goes out.
    Anne knows that nobody will be home for hours and its getting dark.
    Since it's a Sunday she knows that a matinence person can't come to fix it, so she can either
    go out to get candles, or go outside and try to fix the electric panel box.
