  <p>Anne goes outside to try to get the lights back on but it seems to be impossible.
    She keeps trying to fix the electrical box but then hears a noise in the bushes.
     She looks back and sees a clown off in the distance looking at her! She quickly runs back in her house
     and locks the doors.</p>
