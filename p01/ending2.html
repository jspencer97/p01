    <!--Jack Spencer-->

  <p>Anne runs as fast as she can but she twists her ankle and falls down.
    She can no longer walk so she crawls over to hide behind the nearby tree.
    She sits there as quiet as possible but hears footsteps coming twards her.
    </p>
  <p> Anne peaks behind the tree to see if he's still there. She doesn't see
    anything but then turns around and the clown is staring right at her. She cries out for help
    but nobody can hear her.</p>
