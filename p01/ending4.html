  <!--Jack Spencer-->

  <p>Anne throws the rock as hard as she can and hits the clown. This however barely slows him down as he
    continues to chase her.  She runs into the street and stops an oncoming car. She gets in and tells the driver
    to get out of there quickly. They go to the police and Anne tells them everything that happened.</p>
